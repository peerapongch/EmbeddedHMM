MSc Project: Inference in high dimensional state space models with Embedded HMM method

This project is co-supervised by Alexander Shestopaloff and Arnaud Doucet.
Brief description: State space models are an important class of models with wide use in a
variety of disciplines such as biology, econometrics and signal processing. This project will
consider Bayesian inference in state space models where the state can be high-dimensional
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that have recently been developed in
Shestopaloff and Neal (2017). The student working on the project will first reproduce the
results of the methods presented in this paper, implementing the samplers for latent states,
and then perform an extension of the results to do Bayesian inference for both parameters
and latent states by adding a sampling step for the parameters, which are currently taken to
be known.
